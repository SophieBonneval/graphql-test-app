# GraphQL Test App

This is a really simple [GraphQL](https://github.com/apollostack/graphql-tools) test app. 

## Installation

Clone the repository, go to the server directory and run `npm install`

```
git clone https://github.com/SophieBonneval/graphql-test-app.git
cd graphql-test-app && cd server
npm install
```

## Starting the server

The server will run on port 4000. You can change this by editing `app.js`.
